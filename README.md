# `Expense App`

This app helps you with managing Income and Expense. It is coded in flutter, dart hive. TBH I want to code the same app in Flutter , React and Jetpack Compose to see the difference and get some experience, but let's see what Happens. :) 🤠🤗

```
Note : This is right now an active project where I 
am making changes, If you want the same version as 
in Youtube Tutorial Version 1 : Download the zip 
file the same name.
```

## Making Changes for V2
    - Removed Gradient Code
    - Adding Date and Delete Option in each Expense Tile
